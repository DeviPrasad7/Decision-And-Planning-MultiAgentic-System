## ⚡ Executive Summary

The **Hybrid Sandwich Agent** is a high-performance, multi-agentic system engineered to solve the **Latency-Accuracy Tradeoff** in Generative AI. By leveraging a **Cost-Based Routing Swarm**, the system dynamically orchestrates requests between ultra-low latency "Fast Tier" models and high-reasoning "Smart Tier" models.

This architecture implements a robust **Sandwich Pattern** (Plan → Execute → Refine), enabling complex Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning for strategic tasks while maintaining **sub-second response times** for direct interaction.

## 🏗️ Architectural Internals

### The Neural Core

* **Orchestration Engine:** `LangChain` + `LiteLLM` (Router)
* **Cognitive Layers:**

  * **🧠 Smart Tier (The Prefrontal Cortex):** Google Gemini 2.5 Flash / 2.5 Pro — Handles planning, synthesis, and error correction.
  * **⚡ Fast Tier (The Motor Cortex):** Groq (Llama-3.1-8b / 3.3-70b) — Handles execution, tool usage, and rapid response.
* **Memory Architecture:** Ephemeral Sliding Window (`deque`) with **Context Injection**, ensuring continuous state awareness with zero latency overhead.
* **Self-Healing Network:** Automated retry logic triggers failover protocols (Groq ↔ Gemini Flash) upon rate-limit detection (429 / Quota Exceeded).

## 💡 Cost & Resource Strategy (Free-Tier Optimized)

This project is intentionally engineered to operate at **zero infrastructure cost**, leveraging **free-tier models** and resources exclusively during the Alpha phase. To achieve reliability, throughput, and fault tolerance under free-tier constraints, the system employs a **multi-key load-balancing** strategy.

**Multiple API keys**—provisioned across separate Google accounts—are rotated and dynamically balanced to distribute request load, mitigate rate limits, and maintain uninterrupted service availability. This approach enables real-world stress testing of agentic orchestration, routing logic, and failover behavior without incurring any paid usage, while closely simulating production-scale traffic patterns.

This design choice reinforces the project’s goals of:

* Cost-efficiency by design

* Resilience under constrained resources

* Realistic LLMOps experimentation without financial overhead

## 🔮 Roadmap & Future Evolution

This project is currently in **Alpha Phase**. The monolithic core is being actively decoupled into a scalable microservices architecture.

* **🌐 API Exposure (FastAPI):** Transitioning project into a high-concurrency RESTful API to serve as a backend for web and mobile clients.
* **☁️ Cloud Native (GCP):** Containerization (Docker) and deployment to Google Cloud Run for serverless auto-scaling and high availability.
* **🖥️ Real-Time Interface (React):** Developing a "Glass Box" UI to visualize the agent's "Thinking Process" (Plan → Execute → Refine) in real time.
* **📚 Long-Term Memory (RAG):** Integration with Vector Databases (Pinecone / Faiss) to persist user context beyond the current session.
